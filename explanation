Explanation of the Dockerfile:
Base Image:

We're using ubuntu:20.04 as the base operating system.
Install Nginx:

The RUN command updates the package list and installs Nginx (a web server) and any dependencies.
Working Directory:

WORKDIR sets the working directory inside the container to /var/www/html, where Nginx serves files by default.
Copy Files:

The COPY commands copy the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from your local machine into the container.
Expose Port:

The EXPOSE 80 line tells Docker that the container will listen on port 80, which is the default HTTP port.
Start Nginx:

The CMD command runs Nginx in the foreground when the container starts.
Steps to Build and Run the Docker Container:
Save the Dockerfile in the same directory where your index.html, styles.css, and scripts.js files are located.

Build the Docker Image: In the terminal, navigate to the directory where your Dockerfile is located and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t tutorial-app .
Run the Docker Container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 8080:80 tutorial-app
This will map port 80 from inside the container to port 8080 on your local machine.

Access the App:

Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080 to see your tutorial website running inside the Docker container.
